## Before using ChillCoders' PicGenerator,
    1. make a simple text file,
    2. save it as 'db_config.txt',
    3. put it into the same folder, where the application runs.

##### The file should include the next row filled with your own, personal datas:

> dbname='python_visualization_project' user='yourusername'host='localhost' password='yourpassword'

##### This file is ultimately going to be ignored by Git.

### Thank you for your contribution!
